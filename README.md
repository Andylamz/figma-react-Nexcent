# Nexcent (Figma to React Proejct)

## Overview

This is a static frontend project built with React and Tailwind CSS, based on a free design I found on Figma.
The goal of this project was to practise converting a Figma into a working web page.

Since the design did not include responsive layouts, this project is not responsive and is optimised for large screens(1440px).

## Features

  - Converted directly from a Figma design
  - Built with React + Tailwind CSS
  - Pixel perfect styling (aligned with the Figma design)
  - Static pages only (no backend)

## Tech Stack

  - React
  - Tailwind CSS
  - Figma (design reference)
